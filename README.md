# Robot
A robot nueral network-esque program.

The goal of this program is to make a sereies of robots that will be placed onto a board to collect batteries to live as long as possible. Once the first series of robots die out, they will be replaced by their children who take genes from the parents to hopefully make better robots that will live longer after having good genes passed to them from their parents.
