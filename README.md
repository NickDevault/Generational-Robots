# Generational Robots
A robot nueral network-esque program.

The goal of this program is to make a series of robots that will be placed onto a board to collect batteries to live as long as possible. Once the first series of robots die out, they will be replaced by their children who take genes from the parents to hopefully make better robots that will live longer after having good genes passed to them from their parents. This will repeat for a set amount of generations and their fitness scores  will be tracked every generation. By the end of the simulation there will be a noticable improvement in the later generations scores compared to the first generations.
